# 🌊 TideTech Authentication Project

Welcome to the TideTech Authentication Project! This is a practice project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to learn about authentication and authorization in web applications. 

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using their credentials.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication for user sessions.
- **Protected Routes**: Users must be logged in to access certain routes (e.g., the homepage).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed login/signup attempts.
- **Local Storage**: User tokens and information are stored in local storage for session management.
- **Professional Practices**: Utilizes best practices for security and performance, including bcrypt for password hashing and CORS for cross-origin requests.
